## V10 Data Path update

When updating to V10 you will probably need to update your datapaths, this basically means removing any `data` from the path, for example for dnd5e it would be `attributes.hp.value` as you can see the `data.` is no longer in the path.

## ATTENTION!

On some systems the `Creature Type` and `Custom Creature Type` options might cause Splatter to not work correctly, simply go into the module settings for Splatter and empty both those settings leaving them blank.

## CONFIGURATIONS

If you manually added the data paths for your System to splatter, please send in a PR for config.js (https://github.com/theripper93/Splatter/blob/main/scripts/config.js)

For information on how to configure Splatter for your system please read this https://github.com/theripper93/Splatter/blob/main/CONFIGURATIONS.MD
You are also free to send in PRs with configurations for missing systems!

## NOTICE: FEATURE REQUESTS

I know that this implementation doesen't have all the features BnG had BUT i feel like it has enough customization for most people. Because the point of this module is to keep it streamlined to avoid making it impossible to mantain no feature requests will be implemented. Unless is something that all the users of this module would greatly benfit from, please refrain from asking. Thanks for your understanding :)

## FAQ

**Blood and guts exists, why make a new one?:** Blood and guts was a massive project and while it was amazing, with a lot of code comes a lot of issues and it's extremely difficult to mantain and fix. This implementation is simpler and more streamlined, and while it has less features, it will be much easier to mantain and adopt if it ever gets abandoned
